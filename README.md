Introduction
The Adview Predictor project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the number of ad views a YouTube video might generate. The project leverages data such as video metadata, engagement metrics, and other relevant features to train a predictive model.

Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
Model evaluation and selection
Prediction of ad views for new YouTube videos
Visualization of results
Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone(https://github.com/SailokeshParidala/Internship_Studio_Project)
cd Internship_Studio_Project
Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the dataset by collecting YouTube video data with relevant features.

Run the data preprocessing script:

python preprocess_data.py

Train the model:

python train_model.py

Make predictions on new data:
python predict.py --input new_data.csv --output predictions.csv

Model
The project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict ad views, including:

Linear Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
The model selection is based on evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared score.

Results
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model provided the highest accuracy for predicting ad views. Detailed results and performance metrics are available in the results folder.
